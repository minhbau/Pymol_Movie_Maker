DESCRIPTION

    Certain colors are indistinguishable to people with the various forms of
    color blindness, and therefore are better not used in figures intended for
    public viewing.

    This script generates a palette of named colors for PyMOL that are
    unambiguous both to colorblind and non-colorblind people.

    The colors listed here are defined according to recommendations found at
    http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/html/color_blind/.  This website is a good
    reference to consult when making all kinds of figures, not just those made
    using PyMOL.

    The colors are:

    * cb_black
    * cb_orange
    * cb_sky_blue (also: cb_skyblue, cb_light_blue, cb_lightblue)
    * cb_bluish_green (also: cb_bluishgreen, cb_green)
    * cb_yellow
    * cb_blue
    * cb_vermillion (also: cb_red, cb_redorange, cb_red_orange)
    * cb_reddish_purple (also: cb_rose, cb_violet, cb_magenta)

USAGE

    import colorblindfriendly
    color myObject, cb_red
    color mySel, cb_yellow

REQUIREMENTS

    None.
